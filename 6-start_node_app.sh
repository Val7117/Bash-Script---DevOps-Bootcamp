# EXERCISE 6: Bash Script - Start Node App
# Write a bash script with following logic:

# Install NodeJS and NPM and print out which versions were installed
# Download an artifact file from the URL: https://node-envvars-artifact.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz 39.
# Hint: use curl or wget
# Unzip the downloaded file
# Set the following needed environment variables: APP_ENV=dev, DB_USER=myuser, DB_PWD=mysecret
# Change into the unzipped package directory
# Run the NodeJS application by executing the following commands: npm install and node server.js
# Notes:

# Make sure to run the application in background so that it doesnâ€™t block the terminal session where you execute the shell script
# If any of the variables is not set, the node app will print error message that env vars is not set and exit
# It will give you a warning about LOG_DIR variable not set. You can ignore it for now.
